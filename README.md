welcome to my first react app
which give the option to sign up/ log in
once the user is logged he can create like edit and delete cards (changes will only be avalible to the user's own card's)
when the card is clicked the user will be transferd to card detail page
that will show on a map the location and more detailes

the app is responsive, screen size.. and dark mode...
in the future if god will this website will be improved
